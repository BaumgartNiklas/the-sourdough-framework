Sourdough has been made since ancient times. The exact origins of fermented
bread are, however, unknown. One of the most ancient preserved
sourdough breads has been excavated in Switzerland.
However, based on recent research, some scientists speculate that sourdough
bread had already been made in 12000 BC in ancient Jordan \cite{jordan+bread}.
